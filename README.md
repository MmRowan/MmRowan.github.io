The Ending of War
=================

On *As the World Caves In* by Matt Maltese
------------------------------------------

*(By Mistrum Rowan Sylfsom.)*

[This](https://youtu.be/SwXseZSjLs) official music video fills me with such
compassion and pity for all who face the true grief of and sorrow of being lost
in a hopeless death.

Singer Matt Maltese integrates himself so fluently and wholly within the
self-held scenarios that he serves as a necessary emotional bridge within this
message.

This song focuses its intent upon the horrific latent power of nuclear weaponry;
it is a desperate plea to the peoples of all nations to open their eyes and see
the destruction lying in wait for us.

Instead of attending the presence of fear and hope, I invite you to sit with
yourself presently—to feel what must be felt, to understand what it finding
itself held in your mind, to be aware of the magnificent beauty and horror of
who You are and who I am and who We are, to find the possibility of each moment
by doing nothing at all.

Let yourself empathize with the couple facing death hand in hand—knowing well
that death is faced alone;  
Let yourself empathize with Maltese as he sings loud from the heads and the
hearts of those who acknowledge their doom to perish.

Empathize with all who Live to turn to the face of Death.

Death is a Bomb: oblivion awaits all,  
Whether slowly in the wearing-out and fading-away of bodies, or suddenly in an
explosion of light.

Whether the Bomb of Death shines as a mirror under the Sun, a Jewel in the Sky;
and  
Whether the Bomb of Death clouds the light in plumes of smoke—  
This is up to you, for  
There is no making it different.

The ignorance and knowledge of the urgency of death—self-extinction, forgetting
what was known, slipping and fading away—ring true throughout this radiant work:  
The truest War is the War of Grief—of being unwilling and unable to sacrifice
one’s attachment to what belongs not to oneself.

Upon first acknowledging our inevitable loss, Grief shall overtake us. This
Grief of Loss—of what we Have and of what we Are—is not all-powerful:  
The War unbeatable in combat can end before it is begun.

Lose yourself in these moments.

Recognize the mundane day-to-day.

You cannot take with you what belongs not to You at the time of Death.

Cherish all of your life—gloss not over a single blessing of beauty:

Be present but not longing in each of these infinities of infinitesimal moments:  
These memories—of reminiscing the past and of hoping for a future—,  
These feelings—joy and elation, sorrow and woe—,  
These people—who love you and whom You love; who love you not and whom You love
not—,  
These animals—who become beloved pets and partners, protectors and guides; who
become fantastic beasts of nightmarish tales—,  
These plants—who sustain us as we live and whom we sustain as we perish—  
These seasons of weather—of death in the dark and cold, and of rebirth in the
light and warmth—,  
These winds—gentles breezes and violent gales, which kiss skin and buffet the
face, which soothe the soul and pummel at the heart—,  
These downfalls of precipitation—droplets of rain, which tenderly touch our
cheeks as do tears of sorrow and happiness; and still frost, which touches
sharply our skin and reminds us of the brittleness of longing to keep the
delicate warmths of life.

We have no right to life, as plants and animals have no right by Our hand;  
We have no right to death, as plants and animals have no right by Our hand.

We have the right to Live; We have the right to Die—  
This is the Law, and  
This is the Right of Being Born and of Dying.

We have no right, and certainly cannot attain such a right, to wield the power
of Life and Death.

This is the Birthright, and it is a Law twofold at once:  
The Birthright is the Absolute Right to Live—at the hand of No Other;  
The Birthright is the Absolute Right to Die—at the hand of No Other.

Realization of the Birthright is the Eternal Death of the Wars of Grief.
